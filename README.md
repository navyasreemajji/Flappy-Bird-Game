# Flappy-Bird-Game
This is a Java-based clone of the classic Flappy Bird game, built using the Java Swing framework. The game features a simple user interface where players control a bird that must fly between sets of moving pipes without colliding. The core logic includes custom rendering using Java's Graphics class, real-time event handling with the keyboard, score tracking, and collision detection. This project is ideal for beginners who want to understand the basics of game development in Java, including game loops, GUI programming, and object-oriented design. It can be further improved by adding sound effects, high score tracking, and better visual elements.
